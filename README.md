# Library App

This is a simple library app that allows users to add books to their library and mark them as read or not read. The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app was completed as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project, an open-source web development curriculum.

## Usage

To use the app, simply fill out the form with the book's title, author, number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book. Once you submit the form, the book will be added to your library and displayed on the page.
